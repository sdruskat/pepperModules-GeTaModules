# pepperModules-GeTaModules

A module for the [Pepper](http://corpus-tools.org/pepper/) conversion framework 
for linguistic data.

The module provides an importer for the custom JSON data written by the GeTa 
annotation tool as used in the [TraCES](https://www.traces.uni-hamburg.de/) 
research project.

It can be used to import GeTa data and subsequently manipulate it and export it
to a different format with Pepper.

*GeTaModules* is also provided in a custom GUI for conversion into the ANNIS
format: [Pepper Grinder](https://github.com/sdruskat/pepper-grinder).

## Requirements

- Java >= 1.7
- Pepper ([download](http://corpus-tools.org/pepper/#download), 
[documentation](http://corpus-tools.org/pepper/#documentation)) (module has 
been tested with Pepper v3.1.0)

## Install module

1. Start Pepper (Windows: `pepperStart.bat`, Linux: `bash pepperStart.sh`)
1. `pepper> update de.uni-hamburg::pepperModules-GeTaModules::http://central.maven.org/maven2/`

You can also download the module executable from 
[Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22de.uni-hamburg.traces%22%20AND%20a%3A%22pepperModules-GeTaModules%22) and add the path to the JAR file to the configuration
file `conf/pepper.properties`:

`pepper.dropin.paths=/path/to/the/module/jar`

Pepper will then pick it up automatically.

## Usage

To use the module, either use the conversion wizard in Pepper (started by
the `convert`/`c` sommand without parameters), or create a 
[Pepper workflow file](http://corpus-tools.org/pepper/userGuide.html#workflow_file).

In the workflow:

### Identify the module by name

```xml
<importer name="GeTaImporter" path="PATH_TO_CORPUS"/>
```

### Properties

`GeTaModules` does not provide any custom properties.
